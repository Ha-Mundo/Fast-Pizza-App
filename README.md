# 👋Introduction

Pizza ordering application that allows users to easily select and order pizzas from a dynamic menu. The app focuses on simplicity, eliminating the need for user accounts and login. Users input their names before using the app, and the menu is loaded from an API, enabling menu updates.

## 🌟App Requirements

- Users can order one or more pizzas from a menu.
- No user accounts or login required; users just input their names before using the app.
- The pizza menu can change, so it should be loaded from an API.
- Users can add multiple pizzas to a cart before ordering.
- Ordering requires the user’s name, phone number, and address.
- GPS location should be provided, if possible, to facilitate delivery.
- Users can mark their order as “priority” for an additional 20% of the cart price.
- Orders are made by sending a POST request with the order data (user data + selected pizzas) to the API.
- Payments are made on delivery, so no payment processing is necessary in the app.
- Each order will get a unique ID that should be displayed, allowing users to look up their order based on the ID.
- Users should be able to mark their order as “priority” even after it has been placed.

## 🛠️Technologies Used

- React Router (v6.4)

  - **Routing**: Handles navigation between different pages of the application, such as the menu, cart, and order confirmation.
  - **Data Loading**: Utilizes the latest features for loading data asynchronously, ensuring the menu and other dynamic content are fetched from the API efficiently.`

- Tailwind CSS

  - **Styling**: Provides utility-first CSS classes to style the application, ensuring a consistent and responsive design with minimal custom CSS.

- Redux
  - **UI State Management**: Manages the application's UI state, such as the user's cart, selected pizzas, and order status, ensuring a predictable and maintainable state management solution.
